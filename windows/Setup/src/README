JACK on Windows
=============================================

This installer will install everything to use Jack Audio Connection Kit (JACK) (www.jackaudio.org) on Windows.

=============================================
Microsoft Runtime Libraries
=============================================

In order to use this software, you will need the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 redistributable package. This package is freely available on the Microsoft download center. Please be sure you install the correct version (2008). This package is required by portaudio to run windows specific audio drivers (MME, DSound and ASIO).

=============================================
QJACKCTL on Windows
=============================================

This is a latest version of Rui Nuno Capela QJACKCTL application (http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/) compiled on Windows. 
It is compiled from the latest CVS version which is using QT4 framework. To uses it:

- start qjackctl.exe and configure it the following way:

	- in Setup/Setting, use "jackd -S" at the "Server Path" item. WARNING: on Windows the "-S" parameter is *mandatory* to have the jack server correctly working!!

	- in Setup/Setting, use "portaudio" at the "Driver" item

	- in Setup/Misc, check the "Start JACK audio server at application startup" box

- quit qjackctl.exe and start is again, it should now launch the jack server. Quitting the qjackctl.exe will now close the jack server.

Starting the jack server with another audio device installed on the machine (like an ASIO card) can now be done directly in qjackctl. 
A ">" button at the right of the interface button allows to list the name of all available devices, driven either by "MME", "DirectSound", or "ASIO".
Alternatively using the following command allows to display the names of available devices:

- jackd -d portaudio -l to display the entire list of available audio devices. (jackd -d portaudio -h will display all portaudio driver features)

Then start jackd with the device you want, by using its name, for example:

- jackd -R -S -d portaudio -d "ASIO::MOTU Audio ASIO", then start qjackctl. qjackctl will see the jackd server already running and then can be used normally.


=============================================
JackRouter JACK/ASIO driver
=============================================

JackRouter is an ASIO driver that allows any ASIO compatible application to become a JACK client, thus exchange audio with any other "native" or "Jackified" application. This driver is registered in the system by the installer and becomes available in the list of ASIO drivers when the JACK server is running. A "JackRouter.ini" configuration file allows the application to confgiure how the JackRouter driver behaves.

	- [IO]: the application can obtain any number if JACK input/output ports (not necessarilly equal to the audio card input/output number). [Note that some applications force their input/output channel number].

	- [AUTO_CONNECT] : when 1, the application JACK port will automatically be connected to the machine input/output JACK ports.


=============================================
Known problems
=============================================

- starting/stopping the server several times in QJACKCTL does not work correctly. You'll have to quit qjackctl and launch it again.
